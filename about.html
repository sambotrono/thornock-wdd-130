            <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <p>Rational Rhetoric Exchange started as an idea. One day, after a lengthy discussion and argument with a relative on social media
                founder and CEO of RRE decided that he had had enough of communicating with people in such a based and crude format.
                He thought back to times when he had great discussions with his friends and family in person. The minutes would turn to hours. He knew that there was
                no way to achieve that with the limiting scope of modern social media. With that emphasis and motivation, he set out to creat RRE. 
                hoping that people would be able to communicate with each other intellectually and with intelligent, well thought out arguments.
